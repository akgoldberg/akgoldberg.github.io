I am a fourth year PhD student in the Computer Science Department at Carnegie Mellon University, where I am advised by [Giulia Fanti](https://www.andrew.cmu.edu/user/gfanti/) and [Nihar Shah](https://www.cs.cmu.edu/~nihars/). I am supported in part by an [NSF Graduate Research Fellowship](https://www.nsfgrfp.org/). I am broadly interested in methods to improve decision making from distributed human evaluations. One application area I have considered extensively is scientific peer review. My current reserach looks at (1) approaches for privacy-preserving data sharing of non-tabular data like graphs and time-series, which can enable more transparency into review processes while preserving participant anonymity and (2) leveraging AI and statistical tools to enhance the quality and fairness of review processes.

Prior to CMU, I received my A.B. in Applied Mathematics from Harvard College where I was lucky to work with [Salil Vadhan](https://salil.seas.harvard.edu/). As an undergrad, I did [research](https://dash.harvard.edu/bitstream/handle/1/39011509/GOLDBERG-SENIORTHESIS-2018.pdf?sequence=3&isAllowed=y) on differentially private inference for models of random graphs. Before beginning my PhD, I spent three years working as a data scientist at Facebook on ads transparency and integrity.
