I am a second year PhD student in the Computer Science Department at Carnegie Mellon University, where I am advised by [Giulia Fanti](https://www.andrew.cmu.edu/user/gfanti/) and [Nihar Shah](https://www.cs.cmu.edu/~nihars/). I am interested in data privacy and anonymity, especially with respect to transparent sharing of data.

Prior to CMU, I received my A.B. in Applied Mathematics from Harvard College where I was lucky to work with [Salil Vadhan](https://salil.seas.harvard.edu/). As an undergrad, I did [research](https://dash.harvard.edu/bitstream/handle/1/39011509/GOLDBERG-SENIORTHESIS-2018.pdf?sequence=3&isAllowed=y) on differentially private inference for models of random graphs. Before beginning my PhD, I spent three years working as a data scientist at Facebook on ads transparency and integrity.
