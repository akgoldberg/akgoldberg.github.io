    <p>I am a fifth year PhD student in the Computer Science Department at Carnegie Mellon University, where I am advised by <a href="https://www.andrew.cmu.edu/user/gfanti/">Giulia Fanti</a> and <a href="https://www.cs.cmu.edu/~nihars/">Nihar B. Shah</a>. I am supported in part by an <a href="https://www.nsfgrfp.org/">NSF Graduate Research Fellowship</a>. I am broadly interested in methods to improve decision making from distributed human evaluations. One application area I have considered extensively is scientific peer review.</p>

    <p>My current research focuses on two main areas. First, I work on leveraging AI and statistical tools to enhance the quality and fairness of review processes. Second, I develop methods for privacy-preserving data sharing of non-tabular data like graphs and time-series, which can enable more transparency into review processes while preserving participant anonymity.</p>

    <p>Prior to CMU, I received my A.B. in Applied Mathematics from Harvard College where I was lucky to work with <a href="https://salil.seas.harvard.edu/">Salil Vadhan</a>. As an undergrad, I did research on differentially private inference for models of random graphs. Before beginning my PhD, I spent three years working as a data scientist at Facebook on ads transparency and integrity.</p>
