    <p>I am a fourth year PhD student in the Computer Science Department at Carnegie Mellon University, where I am advised by [Giulia Fanti](https://www.andrew.cmu.edu/user/gfanti/) and [Nihar Shah](https://www.cs.cmu.edu/~nihars/). I am supported in part by an [NSF Graduate Research Fellowship](https://www.nsfgrfp.org/). I am broadly interested in methods to improve decision making from distributed human evaluations. One application area I have considered extensively is scientific peer review.</p>

    <p>My current research focuses on two main areas. First, I work on leveraging AI and statistical tools to enhance the quality and fairness of review processes. Second, I develop methods for privacy-preserving data sharing of non-tabular data like graphs and time-series, which can enable more transparency into review processes while preserving participant anonymity.</p>

    <p>Prior to CMU, I received my A.B. in Applied Mathematics from Harvard College where I was lucky to work with [Salil Vadhan](https://salil.seas.harvard.edu/). As an undergrad, I did [research](https://dash.harvard.edu/bitstream/handle/1/39011509/GOLDBERG-SENIORTHESIS-2018.pdf?sequence=3&isAllowed=y) on differentially private inference for models of random graphs. Before beginning my PhD, I spent three years working as a data scientist at Facebook on ads transparency and integrity.</p>
