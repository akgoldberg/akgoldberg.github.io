excerpt: "When peer review processes face uncertainty in evaluation quality, traditional deterministic selection methods can lead to suboptimal outcomes. We develop a principled approach to randomized selection that balances exploration and exploitation, with applications to grant funding, paper selection, and other evaluation scenarios."
