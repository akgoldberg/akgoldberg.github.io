excerpt: "We study the problem of benchmarking fraud detectors on private graph data, showing that evaluation results alone can enable nearly perfect de-anonymization attacks in realistic settings. We then analyze differential privacy–based defenses and find that existing methods face a fundamental bias–variance trade-off that limits their practical utility."
