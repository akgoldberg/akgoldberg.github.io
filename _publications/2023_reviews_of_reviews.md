excerpt: "We conduct a randomized controlled trial and other analyses examining biases and other sources of error when asking authors, reviewers, and area chairs to evaluate the quality of peer reviews. We establish evidence of length bias, wherein evaluators deem uselessly elongated reviews as higher quality, as well as positive outcome bias, wherein authors prefer positive reviews on their own papers."
